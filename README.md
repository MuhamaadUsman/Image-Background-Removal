# Image-Background-Removal

Image background removal is the process of isolating the foreground objects in an image from the background. This is often done using computer vision techniques and pre-trained models to segment the foreground objects from the background pixels. The result is an image where the background is effectively removed, leaving only the foreground objects visible.
